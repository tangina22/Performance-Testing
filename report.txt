200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 2.5 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1000.
300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 4.7 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2000.
400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 9 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2500.


when 200,300 , 400 concurrent request, found  total 17 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.40%.
Server can handle almost concurrent 300 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
